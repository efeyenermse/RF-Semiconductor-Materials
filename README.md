# High-Frequency Semiconductor Materials Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a comparative analysis of key semiconductor materials used in high-frequency and high-power applications. Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), important material properties such as bandgap energy, electron mobility, breakdown field, dielectric constant, and saturation velocity have been visualized and analyzed.

## Materials Analyzed
- Silicon (Si)
- Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)
- Gallium Nitride (GaN)
- Silicon Carbide (SiC)
- Indium Phosphide (InP)

## Features
- Data imported from Excel
- Visual comparison via scatter plots and bar charts
- Insightful interpretation of material properties
- Source references provided

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`analiz.ipynb`)
3. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and graphs

## File Structure
- `analiz.ipynb` : Main notebook with data analysis and visualization
- `veri.xlsx` : Excel file with material property data
- `References.md` : Source list of research and websites
